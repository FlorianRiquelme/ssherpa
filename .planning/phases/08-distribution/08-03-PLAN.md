<objective>
Create project README with lazygit-style presentation, VHS demo tape script, and verify the complete distribution pipeline end-to-end.

Purpose: The README is the project's first impression — a polished, GIF-forward page drives adoption. The VHS tape enables reproducible demo creation. The checkpoint ensures everything works before the first release.

Output: README.md, demo.tape, and verified distribution readiness.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create README and VHS demo tape</name>
  <files>README.md, scripts/demo.tape</files>
  <action>
**Part A: README.md**

Create `README.md` at project root with lazygit/lazydocker-inspired structure. Per user decision: GIF-forward, minimal but polished, 1Password as one of several features (not prominent).

Claude writes the project tagline (user deferred this to Claude's discretion). Suggested: "Find and connect to the right SSH server, instantly."

Structure:

1. **Header block:**
   - Project name: `# ssherpa`
   - Badge row: GitHub Release badge, License badge (MIT)
   - Centered GIF placeholder: `<p align="center"><img src="demo.gif" alt="ssherpa demo" width="800"></p>`
   - Tagline (bold): the one-liner tagline
   - Brief paragraph (2-3 sentences) explaining what ssherpa does and why

2. **Features section** (title: "Features"):
   - Project-Aware: Automatically suggests servers based on your current git repository
   - Fuzzy Search: Find any server instantly by name, hostname, or user
   - SSH Key Selection: Pick which key to use for each connection
   - 1Password Integration: Manage credentials from 1Password shared vaults
   - Connection History: Recent connections at your fingertips
   - Config Management: Add, edit, and delete SSH connections from the TUI
   - Zero Dependencies: Single binary, instant startup

   Use a simple bullet list with bold labels. No emoji — keep it clean and professional per lazygit style.

3. **Installation section** (title: "Installation"):
   - Homebrew subsection:
     ```sh
     brew tap ssherpa/tap
     brew install ssherpa
     ```
   - Quick Install subsection (macOS/Linux):
     ```sh
     curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/florianriquelme/ssherpa/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
     ```
   - GitHub Releases: link to releases page with brief note about direct download

4. **Quick Start section** (title: "Quick Start"):
   ```sh
   # Launch ssherpa
   ssherpa

   # Re-run setup wizard
   ssherpa --setup

   # Show version info
   ssherpa --version
   ```

5. **Usage section** (title: "Usage"):
   Table or list of key bindings:
   - `j/k` or arrow keys — Navigate servers
   - `/` — Search
   - `Enter` — Connect via SSH
   - `d` — Show server details
   - `a` — Add new server
   - `e` — Edit server
   - `x` — Delete server
   - `p` — Assign project
   - `K` — Change SSH key
   - `q` — Quit

6. **Configuration section** (title: "Configuration"):
   - Brief note that config is stored in `~/.config/ssherpa/config.toml`
   - Mention backend options: SSH config only, 1Password, or both
   - Mention return-to-TUI option

7. **License section** (title: "License"):
   - MIT license line with link to LICENSE file

Keep the README under 150 lines. No CONTRIBUTING.md reference (file doesn't exist yet). No emoji anywhere.

**Part B: VHS demo tape**

Create `scripts/demo.tape`:

```tape
# ssherpa demo recording
# Generate: vhs scripts/demo.tape

Output demo.gif
Set FontSize 14
Set Width 1200
Set Height 600
Set Theme "Catppuccin Mocha"
Set Padding 20

# Launch ssherpa
Type "ssherpa"
Sleep 500ms
Enter

# Wait for TUI to load
Sleep 1.5s

# Navigate the server list
Down 3
Sleep 400ms
Up 1
Sleep 400ms

# Search for a server
Type "/"
Sleep 300ms
Type "prod"
Sleep 800ms

# Clear search
Escape
Sleep 500ms

# Show detail view
Type "d"
Sleep 1.5s

# Return to list
Escape
Sleep 500ms

# Exit
Type "q"
Sleep 500ms
```

This produces a ~8 second demo showing: launch, navigation, search, detail view, and exit. Keep it short per research advice (under 10 seconds for reasonable GIF size).

1. `README.md` exists at project root.
2. README contains install instructions for Homebrew, curl, and GitHub releases.
3. README contains key bindings section.
4. `scripts/demo.tape` exists and is well-formed.
5. README does NOT contain emoji.

  <name>Task 2: Verify distribution pipeline end-to-end</name>
  <files>cmd/ssherpa/main.go, .goreleaser.yaml, scripts/install.sh, README.md</files>
  <action>
Human verification of the complete distribution pipeline. All code has been built by Plans 08-01, 08-02, and Task 1 of this plan. This checkpoint verifies everything works together before the first release.

Verify the following items:

1. Version command: `go build -o ssherpa ./cmd/ssherpa && ./ssherpa --version`
   Expected: Shows "ssherpa dev", commit "none", build date "unknown", Go version, and platform.

2. Onboarding flow:
   - Remove existing config: `mv ~/.config/ssherpa/config.toml ~/.config/ssherpa/config.toml.bak 2>/dev/null`
   - Run: `./ssherpa`
   - Expected: Welcome message, SSH config host count, 1Password setup prompt. Press N to skip.
   - Restore: `mv ~/.config/ssherpa/config.toml.bak ~/.config/ssherpa/config.toml 2>/dev/null`

3. Setup re-trigger: `./ssherpa --setup`
   Expected: Onboarding flow shows even though config exists.

4. GoReleaser dry-run (if goreleaser installed):
   `goreleaser check` and `goreleaser build --snapshot --clean`
   Expected: Check passes, dist/ contains binaries for 6 platform targets.

5. README inspection: Open README.md — verify clean layout, no emoji, correct install instructions, balanced feature list.

6. Terminal compatibility: Run `./ssherpa` in current terminal and inside tmux if available. Verify TUI renders correctly.

7. Install script: `sh -n scripts/install.sh` — no syntax errors.

  <verify>Human confirms all 7 verification items pass.</verify>
  <done>Distribution pipeline verified end-to-end. Ready for first release tag.</done>
